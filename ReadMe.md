<h1>Write a simple traffic light simulation using JavaScript and the 'config' variable below.</h1>

<h4>The traffic light controls an intersection with multiple streets, see 'config.streetNames'. Only one street is given green light at any given time. This street lets 'config.numberOfCarsPassThroughIntersectionPerSecond' cars pass through the intersection.

For the switching green, these rules apply in declining priority:

1. Rule: Each green phase has to be at least 'config.minGreenDurationInMilliSeconds' long, unless there are no cars going through the green light.

2. Rule: When a street has waited config.maxWaitForGreenInMilliSeconds' or longer it should receive green.

3. Rule: When a street has 'config.carsForGreen' or more cars waiting it should receive green.

4. Rule: When all cars have passed through green, the street that has waited the longest and has cars queued should receive green.

A function 'addCar(streetIndex)' is used to queue cars at the intersection. The function is called from somewhere else outside this scope. You can assume no thread related issues.</h4>
